# ML-algo-implementations
This repository contains implementations from scratch of various Machine Learning algorithms.

## Intention
This is an exercise in order to bridge the gap in my understanding between the purely mathematical and purely practical side of using various Machine Learning. The goal here is not to experiment with difficult datasets or complicated problems, or to optimize the performance of the models. Instead, the focus here is to implement some Machine Learning algorithms from scratch, in order to get a fundamental understanding of the what and the how inside a model, which is otherwise a black box when using third party libraries like scikit-learn.

The datasets being used here are standard datasets available in scikit-learn. The amount and complexity of the data is kept to a basic level.

The models are implemented keeping in mind the structure of models in scikit-learn. As such, each model is implemented inside its own class, and has functions like `fit` and `predict`.

I will try to keep the codes as well commented as possible, such as mentioning what and why is happening in various parts of the code, and the things to keep in mind regarding that. Therefore, these codes can hopefully be used as learning or preparatory material for Machine Learning.

## Inspiration
I am closely following the tutorials provided by "Python Engineer" at the following [link](https://github.com/azfar-imtiaz/ML-algo-implementations.git).

## Algorithms implemented
So far, the following algorithms have been implemented:
- [KNN](https://github.com/azfar-imtiaz/ML-algo-implementations/tree/master/KNN)
- [Linear Regression](https://github.com/azfar-imtiaz/ML-algo-implementations/tree/master/LinearRegression)
